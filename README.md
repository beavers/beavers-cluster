1. Getting access to the cluster

Skip this step if you already have access. If not, use the lines below to check for access. Inside a terminal window,

<code>
# ssh into the EECS machine
# this step is required if you are not on OSU's network (e.g., off campus)
ssh -l <username> nome.eecs.oregonstate.edu

# this will open a new ssh session on nome
# from here we ssh into the ENGR cluster submit server
ssh -l <username> submit-em64t-01.hpc.engr.oregonstate.edu

# if you have access, this step should land you on the submit server
</code>
